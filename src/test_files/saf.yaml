# This is a Scope Administration File that can be used in conjunction with [Terminology Engine v2](https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/tev2/tev2-overview).
#
# The first section defines meta-data concerning the scope itself, both for technical use and human use.
# It shows where directories and files live that ar part of the scope, and also
# ways in which people can contribute, raise issues, see what's going on, discuss, etc.
#
scope:
  website: placeholder.com/docs # home page of the terminology
  scopetag: default # identifier that curators have determined for this terminology
  scopedir: ./src/test_files  # URL of the scope-directory
  curatedir: terminology # directory where all curated files are located. Full URL is `scopedir`/`curatedir`
  glossarydir: terminology # directory where all glossary files and GDFs are located. Full URL is `scopedir`/`glossarydir`
  mrgfile: manual-mrg.yaml # file that contains the (default) machine readable glossary. Full URL is `glossarydir`/`mrgfile`
  # hrgfile: glossary-default # file that contains the (default) human readable glossary. Full URL is `glossarydir`/`hrgfile`
  # license: LICENSE.md # file that contains the (default) licensing conditions. Full URL is `scopedir`/`license`
  # statuses: [ proposed, approved, deprecated ] # list of status tags that are defined for terminological artifacts in this scope
  
#
# The second section contains a mapping between scopetags that are used within the scope, and the associated scopedirs.
# This enables tools to find the [SAF](@) of these [scopes](@), and from there all other directories, files etc.
# that live within them, e.g. to use/import their data.
#
scopes:
- scopetags: [ essiflab, essif-lab ] # definition of (scope) tag(s) that are used within this scope to refer to a specific terminology
  scopedir: https://github.com/essif-lab/framework/tree/master/docs/tev2 # URL of the scope-directory

#
# The third section specifies the versions that are actively maintained by the curators.
# For each version, the set of terms is selected that constitute the terminology.
# See the Glossary Generation Tool (GGT) for details about the syntax and semantics.
